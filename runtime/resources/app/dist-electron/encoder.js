// from them than from real cores. A measured number sidesteps that entirely, and also
// accounts for clock speed, thermal limits, and whether a usable GPU is present.

// 6000 kbps spends bits on detail that no longer exists) and useless against the failure
// it most often faces: when the uplink is the bottleneck, a smaller frame at the same
